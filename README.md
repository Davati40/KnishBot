# KnishBot
Public code for my Discord bot. Requres the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) API.

To use the bot on your own, just insert your bot token where it says INSERT_TOKEN_HERE on the last line and an optional invite URL on line 63.

If you'd like to see the bot I have running, you can [view the test server here](https://discord.gg/zAEGFeF) or [use this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=413728059645100039&permissions=36957248&scope=bot) to add my bot to your server.
Feel free to contact me on Discord: Davati#8113.

This has been updated to run with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) version 1.3.2 and Python version 3.8.2.
