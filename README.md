# KnishBot
Public code for my Discord bot. Requres the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) API.

To use the bot on your own, just insert your bot token where it says INSERT_CODE_HERE on the last line.


This has been updated to run with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) version 1.3.2 and Python version 3.8.2.
